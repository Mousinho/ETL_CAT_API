# ETL_CAT_API
This study utilizes a cat image API to practice data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes on Databricks using PySpark. Cat photos will be retrieved from a public API and extracted from JSON responses into Spark DataFrames.
This ETL workflow on unstructured image data provides an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Databricks notebooks, Spark SQL, and Delta Lake functionality in a low-risk way.
